This is my implementation of a Word2Vec neural network. you will need to grab your own datasets if you want to run this. I've tried to keep it as simple as possible.

embeddings_main.py - script to build the vocabulary and train the model

models.py - classes for the NN model, the dataloder and training functions

Tokenizer.py - class for turning text into tokens

Stemmer.py - for stemming text for better model accuracy
